# Workflow for onboarding new members to services (requires admin rights to all resources)

To fully onboard, a new member must:
 - Fill out the onboarding form
 - Accept our GitHub invite
 - Accept our Slack invite
 
 We track those events, as well as our progress in adding them to our resources [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16JcTqlkCRPqrSnykqshrVM2XLf_3HJJiPpAb7qBaOug/edit?usp=sharing).

## Onboarding Overview
The Onboarding form should be checked and updated at least every other business day. Onboarding each person is a typically a multi-day process, because you have to wait for them to accept your invitations. The basic workflow is:
  
  - Add them to our Google Group, and send them an invitation GitHub
  - Add their name to the "Welcome" list in the Weekly Announcements
  - Add them to the correct mailing lists
  - Wait for them to accept the invitations

## Onboarding Walkthrough
To onboard new members, or to continue boarding partially onboarded members, first navigate to the [Onboarding Reponses Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16JcTqlkCRPqrSnykqshrVM2XLf_3HJJiPpAb7qBaOug/edit?usp=sharing).
  Individuals who have newly requested onboarding will not have checks in the first six columns of the spreadsheet. Partially onboarded members will have some boxes checked.
  
  Onboarding tasks should be completed (or checked up on) from left to right for each individual.

### Google Group adds

  If 'Added to Google Group?' is unchecked:
   - Copy their email address from "Alternate email for Google Drive", if they don't have one, use the email address in "Email Address"
   - Note their Title/Position from column O and affiliation from column N
   - Decide what Google Permissions group to add them to:
      - For members of Teams Brown or White **who are working on infrastructure or data access management**, choose [CFDE_Admin](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!managemembers/cfde_admin/add)
      - For everyone else, choose [CFDE_Everyone](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!managemembers/cfde_everyone/add)
   - (You can also reach those pages by going to [Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!myforums), choosing 'Manage members' for the appropriate group, and then clicking 'Direct add members' on the left side of the screen.)
   - Enter the email address of the person you want to onboard. If you have more than one to add to a given group, you can add multiple, comma-seperated, email addresses
   - Ensure that the welcome message box is filled correctly (see below), then click `Add` at the top of the screen
   - As soon as you've added them to the Google Group, you should add them to the Welcome list on the Announcements list. Go to [the issues for the announcements repo](https://github.com/nih-cfde/announcements/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+Announcements)
   - Click on the issue called "Weekly Announcements"
   - Scroll to the bottom of the page to the text box.
   - Make the first line say `# Welcome`
   - List the name and group affiliation of each person you added to Google Groups as in: `Brown Group: Amanda Charbonneau, Titus Brown`
   - Click the `Comment` button
   - Check the 'Added to Google Group?' box for each person you added

 - Add their name and address to the 'Emails' box in this format: `Name <email@example.com>`
 - Click `+ Add Members`

      - Go to [the form view for onboarding](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1sFY6y2eHB3PS0HayEyxXtZOrBJV7lfT8thJ8bL9wKqQ/edit#responses)
      - Click on the 'Individual' tab
      - Click where it says 'achar@ucdavis.edu'. That will open a selection box where you can choose the email address of the member you're working on
      - Choose the right email address
      - Scroll to the bottom of their form to the 'Mailing List Options' section
